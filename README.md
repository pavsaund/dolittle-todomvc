# dolittle-todomvc

Sample application based on a simple Dolittle backend, that serves multiple forntends of a ToDo-application. The frontends used here are from the popular [TodoMVC open source project](http://todomvc.com/).

The idea is to leverage these existing frontend solutions, and connect them to the Dolittle backend.
